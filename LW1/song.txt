Fire Again
VALORANT

Am I learning my lesson
Never running from wreckage
When it's getting too close?

A million reasons to turn
A million ways to get burned
And still inside it I go

I'm caught inside the fire again
I'm caught inside the fire again

Follow me into the depths of hell
Maybe we're already in it and too close to tell
In another life we might be playing it safe
But not here, we fear none, we're playing with fate

Don't bе fooled or mistaken by my angel facе
I'm just a hothead looking for a reason to break
I'm the wizard of death
I'll come and visit you next
Whisper my name, on an exhale your very last breath

I'm caught inside the fire again
I'm caught inside the fire again
The fire again

I'm caught inside of the fire again
I'm caught inside of the fire again

Follow me into the depths of hell
Maybe we're already there and too close to tell
In another life we might be playing it safe
But not here, we fear none, we're playing with fate

Don't be fooled or mistaken by my angel face
I'm just a hothead looking for a reason to break
I'm the wizard of death
I'll come and visit you next
Whisper my name, on an exhale your very last breath

I'm caught inside the fire again
I'm caught inside the fire again
The fire again
The fire again

I'm the wizard of death
I'll come and visit you next
Whisper my name, on an exhale your very last
